## Welcome Bird Person Inc

He is an old friend of Rick's and has seemingly known Morty since he was a baby.
He attends Rick's party looking for a new mate after ending his soul-bond with
his previous spirit-partner. At the end of the episode, he gets back in the
saddle with one of Summer's high school friends, Tammy.

## Biography

Birdperson first appears in
[Ricksy Business](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Ricksy_Business), where he
attends Rick's party and hooks up with Summer's friend, Tammy. He is also one of
the very few party-goers who remains behind to help clean up, although he may
have just been waiting for Tammy to be ready to leave.

When Morty shows his frustration at the party's mess as it would mean no more
adventures with Rick if his parents see the house in this state, Birdperson
informs Morty that "Wubba lubba dub dub" means "I am in great pain, please help
me" in his native language. Morty is skeptical that Rick actually means this,
though this knowledge spurs him to eventually press Rick into action to preserve
their ability to go on adventures together.

Birdperson later reappears, along with Tammy, in the episode
[Get Schwifty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1188GO4p1E), where he saves
Morty's life after the latter jumped through numerous, hostile dimensions before
collapsing from exhaustion. He explains to Morty that leaving Rick was a "dick
move", and that Rick really does care about him. Furthermore, if it wasn't for
Rick, he [Birdperson] would be dead and would never have met Morty. He then
recharges the
[Portal gun](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Portal_gun_and_Portal_technology)
and sends Morty back to Rick.

In
"[The Wedding Squanchers](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/The_Wedding_Squanchers)",
he and Tammy get married and have a huge wedding party. During this time, he
confessed to [Beth Smith|Beth](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Beth_Smith)
that he and Rick are wanted by the
[Galactic Federation](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Federation)
for committing "crimes in the name of freedom" which Beth shrugs off. Shortly
after, during the reception, Tammy reveals herself to be a member of the
Galactic Federation secret service and shoots Birdperson multiple times,
followed by a shootout with the rest of the criminals in the room.

Birdperson makes a cameo appearance in
"[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/The_Whirly_Dirly_Conspiracy)",
in the form of a small statue that can be seen in the background.

Until her identity was revealed to be false, Birdperson was a devoted love
interest to Tammy. He was calm and conservative while she had no filter in the
things she said, no matter how inappropriate. It was revealed in the commentary
for [Get Schwifty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1188GO4p1E) that the
creators were displeased with how the way things ended, finding humor in their
brief relationship.
[Dan Harmon|Harmon](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harmon) and
[Ryan Ridley|Ridley](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Ryan_Ridley) in
particular considered recreating that formula in some way, admiring the dynamic
between Tammy and Birdperson.

## Phoenixperson

[[File:Pheonixperson.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Birdperson revived as
"Phoenixperson". ]]{{Quote|I am Phoenixperson.|Birdperson after being revived as
Phoenixperson|The Rickshank Rickdemption}} In the ending credits for [[The
Rickshank Rickdemption]], Tammy and the
[Gromflomites](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Gromflamites) resurrected
Birdperson as a cyborg and renamed him Phoenixperson. Although Tammy wanted his
name to be Cyberbird, she didn't push hard enough to make that official. She
settled on Phoenixperson and took off with him.

## Appearance

[[File:BirdpersonTransparent.png|left|160px]]
[[File:Phoenixperson.transparent.png|right|160px]] Birdperson is a tall humanoid
with bird-like features. He has two giant eagle wings with gray on the ends,
that drape down along his back like a cape. He also wears yellow gloves, a red
skirt, and yellow boots. He has a green, feathery helmet with white polka dots.
The tuft of feathers on his head ruffles when he moves. {{clear}}

## Personality

Birdperson is very wise, having experienced so much about the universe with his
best friend, [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]]. He offers well-meaning advice to anyone
willing to listen to him, like [[Morty Smith|Morty]]. He is also very nice,
although at times he can be perceived as tedious, most notably to [[Beth
Smith|Beth]], because of his monotone voice, limited facial expressions, and
scarce bodily movement.

## Relationships

### [Rick Sanchez](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Rick_Sanchez)

Birdperson and Rick are life long friends, having done lots of things together.
Birdperson attended Rick's party in the episode
[Ricksy Business](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Ricksy_Business). He showed
concern for Rick's well being, telling Morty that "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub" means "I
am in great pain, please help me." He invited Rick to his wedding in the episode
[The Wedding Squanchers](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/The_Wedding_Squanchers).
In the same episode, Rick was shown to be very torn apart, when he saw
Birdperson die.

### [Morty Smith](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Morty_Smith)

Birdperson and Morty are fond acquaintances of each other. Birdperson explained
Rick's catchphrase to Morty in the episode
[Ricksy Business](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Ricksy_Business), and
offered him his advice. He also nursed Morty back to health when he found him
wounded in the episode
[Get Schwifty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1188GO4p1E). In that same
episode, Birdperson also serves as a form of guidance for Morty, bestowing a lot
of wisdom on him and explaining to him why he should consider putting his faith
in Rick Sanchez.

### [Squanchy](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Squanchy)

Birdperson and Squanchy have apparently also been friends for a long time. In
the episode [Get Schwifty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1188GO4p1E) it was
shown that when they were much younger, he, Birdperson, and Rick, started up a
band together, called
[The Flesh Curtains](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/The_Flesh_Curtains).
Squanchy was also honored to hold Birdperson and Tammy's wedding on his
[Planet Squanch|home planet](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Planet_Squanch).

### [Beth Smith](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Beth_Smith)

During her conversation with Birdperson in
[The Wedding Squanchers](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/The_Wedding_Squanchers),
Beth tells Birdperson how she used to draw Rick into her family photos with a
crayon. Birdperson told Beth how he fought alongside him against the
[Galactic Federation](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Federation).
Beth was saddened by this. She is envious of Birdperson for all the time he
spent with Rick. In spite of this, she is very supportive of him on his wedding
day.

_"The Beacon was activated. Who is in danger?" ''(First Quote)'' _"'Wubba lubba
dub dub' means 'I am in great pain, please help me'." _"'Gubba nub nub doo rah
kah' means 'Whatever lets you sleep at night'." _"You appear to be dying. I will
make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing." _"Is your intention to
abandon Rick, using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a
dick move." _"Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had
to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs,
possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars
and wonder what might have been, had you just put your faith in Rick?" _"Tammy,
I was approaching infertility when I met you but there is still time. I am yours
until my death." ''(Wedding Vow)'' _"In Bird culture this is considered a dick
move."
